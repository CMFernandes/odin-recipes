    <h2> How to make the best Yogurt Cake</h2>

    <p>Yogurt Cake, a simple, easy and delicious Snack or Dessert.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup (226g) plain whole milk yogurt, regular or Greek</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil, canola oil or olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (192g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Powdered sugar, for dusting</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Grease a 9x5-inch or 8 1/2 x 4 1/2-inch loaf pan lightly with olive oil and line it with parchment paper, leaving about a 1-inch overhang on the long sides, to make a sling.</li>
        <li>Crack the eggs into a large bowl, add the sugar, and whisk vigorously until pale yellow and frothy, about 1 minute. Whisk in the yogurt, oil, and vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>To the bowl with the wet ingredients, whisk in the baking powder and kosher salt. Add the flour and stir with a rubber spatula until just combined and all of the flour is incorporated. (A few small lumps in the batter are fine, be sure to not overmix.)</li>
        <li>Transfer the batter to the prepared pan and use a spatula to spread it out evenly. Bake until the cake is lightly browned and a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean with just a few crumbs, about 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pan to a cooling rack and let cool for 10 minutes before using the parchment paper sling to lift the cake out of the pan and onto the cooling rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Dust with powdered sugar, if desired, before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
