    <h2> How to make the best Stroganoff</h2>

    <p>Use chicken thigh fillets if you prefer in this chicken stroganoff, and use half-fat soured cream for a lighter version. Enjoy with pasta, mash or rice.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>4 skinless chicken breasts, cut into chunks</li>
        <li>2 onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sweet paprika</li>
        <li>400ml chicken stock</li>
        <li>4 tsp Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>200g soured cream or crème fraiche</li>
        <li>a large handful of parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>rice mash or pasta, to serve</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat half the oil in a frying pan and fry the chicken pieces over a medium high heat, stirring frequently. until golden brown. Season and transfer to a plate.</li>
        <li>Heat the remaining oil and lower the heat to medium. Fry the onion for 6-8 mins until softened but not golden, then stir in the garlic and paprika. Fry for a minute until fragrant, then pour in the stock, and add the Dijon. Tip in the seared chicken with any resting juices, and simmer for 5-6 mins until reduced slightly and the chicken is cooked through.</li>
        <li>Over a low heat, stir in the soured cream until just combined to create a creamy sauce, and it’s just started to simmer. Scatter over the parsley and serve with rice, mash or pasta, if you like.</li>
    </ol>
